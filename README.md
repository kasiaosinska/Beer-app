This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It is small website with collection of beers. I used https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2.
To start a project run yarn start or npm start then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
